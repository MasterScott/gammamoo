  File I/O
  Ken Fox, Andy Bakun, Todd Sundsted

  This is the documentation for the File I/O (FIO) extension for the
  LambdaMOO server.  FIO adds several administrator-only builtins for
  manipulating files from inside the MOO.  Security is enforced by
  making these builtins executable with wizard permissions only as well
  as only allowing access to a directory under the current directory
  (the one the server is running in).

  1.  Introduction

  1.1.  Purpose

  This extension to the LambdaMOO server adds several new builtins that
  allow the manipulation of files from MOO code.   The new builtins are
  structured similarly to the stdio library for C.  This allows MOO-code
  to perform stream-oriented I/O to files.

  Granting MOO code direct access to files opens a hole in the otherwise
  fairly good wall that the LambdaMOO server puts up between the OS and
  the database.  The extension contains the risk as much as possible by
  restricting where files can be opened and allowing the new builtins to
  be called by wizard permissions only.  It is still possible execute
  various forms denial of service attacks, but the MOO server allows
  this form of attack as well.

  There is a related package available that contains a db front end for
  this package as well as a help database with help for all the builtin
  functions and for the front end.  It is not recommended that you use
  these functions directly.

  2.  Installation

  To enable this extension, you must edit options.h prior to compiling
  and uncomment out the following line:
         #define FILE_IO 1

  If you wish to use the logger feature (see section 4), you may also
  (or instead) uncomment the line further down:
         #define FILE_IO_LOGGER 1

  You may also edit other detailed settings:
    FILE_IO_MAX_FILES           the limit of files open
    FILE_SUBDIR                 the File I/O jail directory
    FILE_IO_BUFFER_LENGTH       the maximum line/data length
    FILE_IO_LOGGER_SUBDIR       the logger jail directory
    FILE_IO_LOGGER_FORMAT       printf format used for log filenames
    FILE_IO_LOGGER_FORMAT_VARS  variables used for strftime formatting
                                pick from: time, counter, and pathname
    FILE_IO_LOGGER_FORMAT_TIME  strftime format used for log filenames

  Finally, make the jail directories in the directory the MOO server is
  run in.  Only files in these directories will be accessible using this
  extension.

         mkdir files logs

  Pathnames passed to these functions are restricted to prevent access
  outside this directory.

  3.  Functions

  The functions in this patch are grouped into a few categories.  There
  is a function to open a file and a function for closing a file, a set
  of functions for doing stream-oriented I/O from files, and a set of
  housekeeping functions.

  Function documentation includes a prototype, information about the
  function, and a list of exceptions the function might raise (in
  addition to the ones outlined in "Error handling".

  WARNING: All of the actual I/O functions in this package are
  implemented using the stdio portion of libc.  Your system's
  documentation may have applicable warnings for these functions.  When
  appropriate, the function documentation will say which libc function
  is used.

  3.1.  Error handling

  Errors are always handled by raising some kind of exception.  The
  following exceptions are defined:

     E_FILE
        This is raised when a stdio call returned an error value.
        CODE is set to E_FILE, MSG is set to the return of strerror()
        (which may vary from system to system), and VALUE depends on
        which function raised the error.  When a function fails
        because the stdio function returned EOF, VALUE is set to
        "EOF".

     E_INVARG
        This is raised for a number of reasons.  The common reasons are
        an invalid FHANDLE being passed to a function and an invalid
        pathname specification.  In each of these cases MSG will be set
        to the cause and VALUE will be the offending value.

     E_PERM
        This is raised when any of these functions are called with non-
        wizardly permissions.

  3.2.  Version

  Function: STR file_version()

  Returns the package shortname/version number of this package e.g.

         ;file_version()
         => "FIO/1.5p3"

  3.3.  Opening and closing of files and related functions

  File streams are associated with FHANDLES.  FHANDLES are similar to
  the FILE* using stdio.  You get an FHANDLE from file_open.  You should
  not depend on the actual type of FHANDLEs (currently TYPE_INT).
  FHANDLEs are not persistent across server restarts.  That is, files
  open when the server is shut down are closed when it comes back up and
  no information about open files is saved in the DB.

  3.3.1.  file_open

  Function: FHANDLE file_open(STR pathname, STR mode)

  Raises: E_INVARG if mode is not a valid mode, E_QUOTA if too many
  files open
  This opens a file specified by pathname and returns an FHANDLE for it.
  It ensures pathname is legal.  mode is a string of characters
  indicating what mode the file is opened in.  The mode string is four
  characters.

  The first character must be (r)ead, (w)rite, or (a)ppend.  The second
  must be '+' or '-'.  This modifies the previous argument.

  o  r- opens the file for reading and fails if the file does not exist.

  o  r+ opens the file for reading and writing and fails if the file
     does not exist.

  o  w- opens the file for writing, truncating if it exists and creating
     if not.

  o  w+ opens the file for reading and writing, truncating if it exists
     and creating if not.

  o  a- opens a file for writing, creates it if it does not exist and
     positions the stream at the end of the file.

  o  a+ opens the file for reading and writing, creates it if does not
     exist and positions the stream at the end of the file.

     If the first character is an uppercase 'A', all write attempts
     will seek to the end of the file prior to writing.

     The third character is either (t)ext or (b)inary.  In text mode,
     data is written as-is from the MOO and data read in by the MOO is
     stripped of unprintable characters.  In binary mode, data is
     written filtered through the binary-string->raw-bytes conversion
     and data is read filtered through the raw-bytes->binary-string
     conversion.  For example, in text mode writing " 1B" means three
     bytes are written: ' ' Similarly, in text mode reading " 1B" means
     the characters ' ' '1' 'B' were present in the file.  In binary
     mode reading " 1B" means an ASCII ESC was in the file.  In text
     mode, reading an ESC from a file results in the ESC getting
     stripped.

  It is not recommended that files containing unprintable ASCII  data be
  read in text mode, for obvious reasons.

  The final character is either 'n' or 'f'.  If this character is 'f',
  whenever data is written to the file, the MOO will force it to finish
  writing to the physical disk before returning.  If it is 'n' then
  this won't happen.

  This is implemented using fopen().

  3.3.2.  file_close

  Function: void file_close(FHANDLE fh)

  Closes the file associated with fh.

  This is implemented using fclose().

  3.3.3.  file_name

  Function: STR file_name(FHANDLE fh)

  Returns the pathname originally associated with fh by file_open().
  This is not necessarily the file's current name if it was renamed or
  unlinked after the fh was opened.

  3.3.4.  file_openmode

  Function: STR file_openmode(FHANDLE fh)

  Returns the mode the file associated with fh was opened in.

  3.4.  Input and Ouput operations

  3.4.1.  file_readline

  Function: STR file_readline(FHANDLE fh)

  Reads the next line in the file and returns it (without the newline).

  Not recommended for use on files in binary mode.

  This is implemented using fgetc().

  3.4.2.  file_readlines

  Function: LIST file_readlines(FHANDLE fh, INT start, INT end)

  Rewinds the file and then reads the specified lines from the file,
  returning them as a list of strings.  After this operation, the stream
  is positioned right after the last line read.

  Not recommended for use on files in binary mode.

  This is implemented using fgetc().

  3.4.3.  file_writeline

  Function: void file_writeline(FHANDLE fh, STR line)

  Writes the specified line to the file (adding a newline).

  Not recommended for use on files in binary mode.

  This is implemented using fputs().

  3.4.4.  file_read

  Function: STR file_read(FHANDLE fh, INT bytes)

  Reads up to the specified number of bytes from the file and returns
  them.

  Not recommended for use on files in text mode.

  This is implemented using fread().

  3.4.5.  file_write

  Function: INT file_write(FHANDLE fh, STR data)

  Writes the specified data to the file.  Returns number of bytes
  written.

  Not recommended for use on files in text mode.

  This is implemented using fwrite().

  3.4.6.  Getting and setting stream position

  3.4.7.  file_tell

  Function: INT file_tell(FHANDLE fh)

  Returns position in file.

  This is implemented using ftell().

  3.4.8.  file_seek

  Function: void file_seek(FHANDLE fh, INT loc, STR whence)

  Seeks to a particular location in a file.  whence is one of the
  strings:

  o  "SEEK_SET" - seek to location relative to beginning

  o  "SEEK_CUR" - seek to location relative to current

  o  "SEEK_END" - seek to location relative to end

  This is implemented using fseek().

  3.4.9.  file_eof

  Function: INT file_eof(FHANDLE fh)

  Returns true if and only if fh's stream is positioned at EOF.

  This is implemented using feof().

  3.5.  Housekeeping operations

  3.5.1.  file_size, file_mode, file_last_access, file_last_modify,
  file_last_change

  Function: INT file_size(STR pathname)
  Function: STR file_mode(STR pathname)
  Function: INT file_last_access(STR pathname)
  Function: INT file_last_modify(STR pathname)
  Function: INT file_last_change(STR pathname)
  Function: INT file_size(FHANDLE fh)
  Function: STR file_mode(FHANDLE fh)
  Function: INT file_last_access(FHANDLE fh)
  Function: INT file_last_modify(FHANDLE fh)
  Function: INT file_last_change(FHANDLE fh)

  Returns the size, mode, last access time, last modify time, or last
  change time of the specified file.   All of these functions also take
  FHANDLE arguments and then operate on the open file.

  These are all implemented using fstat() (for open FHANDLEs) or stat()
  (for pathnames).

  3.5.2.  file_stat

  Function: void file_stat(STR pathname)
  Function: void file_stat(FHANDLE fh)

  Returns the result of stat() (or fstat()) on the given file.
  Specifically a list as follows:

  {file size in bytes, file type, file access mode, owner, group,
       last access, last modify, and last change}

  owner and group are always the empty string.

  It is recommended that the specific information functions file_size,
  file_type, file_mode, file_last_access, file_last_modify, and
  file_last_change be used instead.  In most cases only one of these
  elements is desired and in those cases there's no reason to make and
  free a list.

  3.5.3.  file_rename

  Function: void file_rename(STR oldpath, STR newpath)

  Attempts to rename the oldpath to newpath.

  This is implemented using rename().

  3.5.4.  file_remove

  Function: void file_remove(STR pathname)

  Attempts to remove the given file.

  This is implemented using remove().

  3.5.5.  file_mkdir

  Function: void file_mkdir(STR pathname)

  Attempts to create the given directory.

  This is implemented using mkdir().

  3.5.6.  file_rmdir

  Function: void file_rmdir(STR pathname)

  Attempts to remove the given directory.

  This is implemented using rmdir().

  3.5.7.  file_list

  Function: LIST file_list(STR pathname, [ANY detailed])

  Attempts to list the contents of the given directory.  Returns a list
  of files in the directory.  If the detailed argument is provided and
  true, then the list contains detailed entries, otherwise it contains a
  simple list of names.

  detailed entry:
    {STR filename, STR file type, STR file mode, INT file size}
  normal entry:
    STR filename

  This is implemented using scandir().

  3.5.8.  file_type

  Function: STR file_type(STR pathname)

  Returns the type of the given pathname, one of "reg", "dir", "dev",
  "fifo", or "socket".

  This is implemented using stat().

  3.5.9.  file_mode

  Function: STR file_mode(STR filename)

  Returns octal mode for a file (e.g. "644").

  This is implemented using stat().

  3.5.10.  file_chmod

  Function: void file_chmod(STR filename, STR mode)

  Attempts to set mode of a file using mode as an octal string of
  exactly three characters.

  This is implemented using chmod().

  4.  Logger

  This extension supports a special mode for append-once log files.
  If enabled, any file named starting with '/LOG/' (it must be
  uppercase) will be considered an append-once log. These files may only
  be opened for writing under the capital-(A)ppend mode, and may have
  their names modified to be unique before creating them. The modified
  name can be discovered using the file_name() function. Once closed,
  the files may be read, but are strictly read-only.

  Furthermore, the functions file_remove(), file_rename(), and
  file_chmod() are not permitted on these files. With these precautions,
  they should be safe to use for security logging without compromising
  your filesystem.
